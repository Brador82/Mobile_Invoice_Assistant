---

### Highlights

This release delivers major OCR accuracy improvements, a complete customer messaging system with Google review integration, and several quality-of-life enhancements for delivery crews in the field.

---

### New Features

#### Enhanced OCR Extraction Engine
- **Comprehensive item parsing** — OCR now extracts serial numbers, model numbers, make/brand, item types, and service flags (Delivery, Install, Haul-Away) from scanned invoices.
- **Brand detection** — Recognizes 30+ appliance brands (Whirlpool, Samsung, LG, GE, Maytag, Frigidaire, Bosch, etc.) and maps them to each delivery item.
- **Alternate phone number support** — Extracts multiple phone numbers while intelligently suppressing company/store header numbers to avoid false positives.
- **Per-item service flags** — Each delivery item carries its own service indicators (delivery, install, haul-away) parsed from OCR text.
- **Rotated/sideways invoice support** — Improved text extraction order handles invoices scanned at any orientation.

#### Customer Messaging System
- **Follow-up messages on delivery completion** — When a delivery is marked complete, the app prompts the driver to send an SMS to the customer.
- **Three message options** — Choose from the main Follow-Up Message, Quick Message 1, or Quick Message 2 — all fully customizable in Settings.
- **Smart placeholders** — Message templates support `{name}`, `{company}`, `{items}`, `{team}`, `{review_url}`, and `{review_text}` for dynamic personalization.
- **Delivery Team branding** — Set a custom delivery team name (e.g., "A4L Delivery Crew") that gets tagged in every customer-facing message and suggested review.
- **Pre-written Google review** — Compose a suggested 5-star review template that gets sent to the customer, pre-filled with their items and team name. Customers just copy, paste, and submit.
- **Auto URL shortening** — Google review URLs are automatically shortened via TinyURL for cleaner SMS messages, with graceful fallback to the full URL.
- **Editable in Settings** — All messages, the delivery team name, review URL, and suggested review text are fully editable from the Customer Messaging section in Settings.

#### Visual Delivery Completion
- **Greyed-out completed deliveries** — Cards for completed deliveries fade to 45% opacity as a visual aid. All card functions (call, navigate, view details, delete) remain fully operational.

#### Service Type Badges
- **Visual service badges** — Each invoice card now displays colored badges for Delivery, Install, Haul-Away, and Service Call, making it easy to see the scope of work at a glance.
- **Delivery/Haul-Away option** — Added as a new service type alongside the existing Delivery, Delivery and Install, Delivery/Install/Haul-Away, and Service Call options.

### Improvements

#### OCR & Data Extraction
- Improved Bill-To section parsing for customer name, address, and phone number accuracy.
- Store/company phone number suppression — header phone numbers from the store are identified and excluded from customer phone assignment.
- Phone number formatting standardized to `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`.
- Global service flag extraction from full OCR text applied to all items when per-item flags aren't found.

#### Manual Extraction
- **Crash fixes** — Null guards in `updateChipState` and region processing prevent crashes when processing selected text.
- **OCR fallback for draw-selection** — When draw-selection yields no pre-scanned text, OCR runs directly on the selected region.
- Thread safety improvements for `charRegions` / `textRegions` in `SelectionOverlayView`.

#### Signature Capture
- Signature div rendering fix.

#### Database
- Room database migrated to version 10 with `altPhone` column support (`MIGRATION_9_10`).
